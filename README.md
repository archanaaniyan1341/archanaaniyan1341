### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**"Hi, Iâ€™m Archana Aniyan, a frontend-focused full stack developer with over 4 years of experience building scalable, user-friendly applications. My core expertise is in React.js, where Iâ€™ve worked extensively on creating responsive, accessible, and performance-optimized interfaces. I also have hands-on experience with Node.js for backend development, integrating APIs, and working with databases like SQL Server.

Iâ€™ve contributed to large-scale migration projects, transforming legacy systems into modern React and Node.js applications, ensuring maintainability through clean architecture and clear separation of concerns. My approach blends technical precision with a strong focus on UI/UX, ensuring applications are not just functional but also visually engaging.

Iâ€™m a continuous learner, adaptable to new technologies, and passionate about delivering high-quality solutions that balance user needs with business goals."**
